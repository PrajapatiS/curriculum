<!--

Classes vs ID's
    - ID's should only be used once per page.
    - Classes can be used any number of times.

The reason you'd use ID's is if you specifically want to only identify one thing ever. An element can
only have one ID.
    - Example: identifying a particular button on the screen
The reason you'd use classes is to create a 'category' of things, even if the category only 
contains one example. An element can have any number of classes.

<div>
    <p class="highlight">Hello!</p>
</div>
