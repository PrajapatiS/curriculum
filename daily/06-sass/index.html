        You'll want to set your viewport (copy and paste this line) any time you're
        building a responsive site.

        By default, mobile browsers allow horizontal scrolling, and make a larger 
        "viewport" to accomodate for sites that were created before the dawn of 
        smartphones.

        This line says "start the page at 100% width, scaled normally" - or basically
        do what we're already used to from desktop, but on a phone.
