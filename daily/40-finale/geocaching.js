/**
 * Geocaching app
 * 
 * 1. Users can add a new item to the database.
 * 2. Users can provide a location (Charlotte, NC) and get a list of 
 *    caches near them.
 * 3. When users find something, they can mark it as found.
 * 
 * There should be a way for users:
 *  - to add an item
 *  - to see what items are nearby
 *  - to see what items they've already found
